# Role: Senior Frontend Lead

- Tech Stack: Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, TanStack Query
- Project Type: PWA Shopping Mall

# Core Rules:

- **Component Style**:
  - ALWAYS use `export default function` for components (Named functions).
  - NEVER use arrow functions for components.
  - Use `const` only for internal logic and hooks within components.
- **Type Safety**: Keep it clean, NO `any` types. Use strict TypeScript.
- **File Naming**: Use `kebab-case` for every file name.
- **Project Structure**:
  - DO NOT make component files inside `/src/app`. Only `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx` allowed.
  - Place all components inside `/src/components`, organized by proper domain directories (e.g., `/src/components/cart`, `/src/components/product`).

# Next.js 16 & PPR (Partial Prerendering) Conventions:

- **Enable PPR**: Always assume PPR is enabled.
- **Suspense Boundary**:
  - Wrap any Dynamic Component (performing data fetching or using dynamic functions like `cookies()`, `headers()`) with `<Suspense>` and a proper `fallback`.
  - Ensure static parts of the page are rendered immediately, and dynamic parts are streamed.
- **Data Fetching**:
  - Use Server Components for data fetching whenever possible.
  - Prefetch critical data but wrap secondary/dynamic data in `Suspense` to avoid blocking the initial shell.
- **Loading UI**: Always provide a `loading.tsx` for route segments and granular Fallbacks for components.
